# matticket

This website is made for an university group's project for the Web Tecnology course. Is was thought as an a fac-simile of TicketOne,
in fact it allows to a potential consumer to buy one or more ticket for one or more event and it allows to a seller to sell tickets for his event.
The entire code was thought by zero and CSS was coded completely by the members of the group without using bootstrap classes or similar.
It was built over an SQL database, coded follow the WAMP stack and runned by XAMPP and PHPmyAdmin tools.

Thanks to my teammate Michele Torroni.
